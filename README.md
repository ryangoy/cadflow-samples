# CADflow.ai API integration samples

Our API can be integrated into any kind of backend for your case management software. Currently, we only have updated sample code for Python.

The sample code uses polling to receive processed files, however CADflow also supports websockets. 

If you would like to see a sample for a specific use case, feel free to make a request for it by sending an email to support@cadflow.ai.
